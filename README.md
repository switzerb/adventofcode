# Advent of Code 2020

If you don't know about [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) yet and this repo is the first you've heard of it -- you are welcome. You are about to discover a delightfully nerdy world of elvish puzzle magic and absurd santa salvation. It was created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) and it's a magnificent creation -- thoughtful, fun and difficult. There are 25 days of seasonally-themed puzzles, one opens every day from Dec 1 to Dec 25. They start pretty straight-forward and get harder and harder as the days go by. Some puzzles I've finished in 15 minutes, and some I'm still working on from 2016.

### Playground
I have found this challenge to be the perfect medium for learning new engineering concepts and languages. The puzzles are complex enough that they lend themselves to [practicing pared-down design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) and grounded in classical engineering enough that I can explore graph theory, abstract data types, performance concerns and whatever else happens to come up.It's the perfect, bite-sized playground for understanding. [One year I got to build a little computer](https://github.com/switzerb/adventofcode/blob/master/2019/lib/computer.rb). The puzzles are all the fun part of engineering all in one humorous package -- business logic is clear! and testable! with a big gold star at the end of a successful run! Whee!

### Previous Years
Last year, [I dug into Ruby](https://github.com/switzerb/adventofcode/tree/master/2019) and this year was [Kotlin](https://github.com/switzerb/aoc2020/tree/master/app/src/main/kotlin/aoc/y2020) and one year my partner and I [made a competitive game out of it in Java!](https://github.com/switzerb/adventofcode/tree/master/2018). He won. I've also given Python and Javascript a try in this space, as well.

The repos for this project have become a bit scattered over the years and last year I attempted to consolidate with limited success.[Previous Repo](https://github.com/switzerb/adventofcode)

### Isn't it uncool to have this repo be public since it's puzzle solutions? 
As anyone who has tried to solve a puzzle of some complexity knows, **having** the answer is not the same as **understanding** the answer. Sometimes, when stumped, I go out on the internet and find breadcrumbs to help me solve my problem, and this repo is in that spirit.

### Project Details
This is a command line project so there is no UI component and it's not really intended to be run as an independent app. For any given day, there is a `main()` method that will initialize a solver with my unique puzzle input as a resource. At some future date, I forsee a project to tie all the solvers together in a more elegant interface, but for now it's a little rough.
